//! # `cv`
//!
//! Batteries-included pure-Rust computer vision crate
//!
//! This crate should only be used for documentation/reference and for quickly creating and
//! running a computer vision sample/routine. It is useful for tutorials and also for
//! experts who want to run something once as a script. It also stores all of the
//! things useful for computer vision in the Rust ecosystem in one place for
//! discoverability. If you are making a production application, import the dependencies
//! from this crate individually so that you don't have an explosive number of dependencies.
//! Although not recommended, you can also disable default features on this crate and
//! enable specific features on this crate just to get the functionality you want.
//!
//! All of the basic computer vision types/dependencies are included in the root of the crate.
//! Modules are created to store algorithms and data structures which may or may not be used.
//! Almost all of the things in these modules come from optional libraries.
//! These modules comprise the core functionality required to perform computer vision tasks.
//!
//! ## Modules
//! * [`camera`] - camera models to convert image coordinates into bearings (and back)
//! * [`consensus`] - finding the best estimated model from noisy data
//! * [`geom`] - computational geometry algorithms used in computer vision
//! * [`estimate`] - estimation of models from data
//! * [`feature`] - feature extraction and description
//! * [`image`] - image opening and processing/manipulation
//! * [`knn`] - searching for nearest neighbors in small or large datasets
//! * [`optimize`] - optimizing models to fit data
//! * [`mvg`] - multiple-view geometry (visual odometry, SfM, vSLAM)
//! * [`video`] - video opening and camera capture
//! * [`vis`] - visualization
